# MelbBitDevs

Melbourne Bitdevs is held on the last Thursday of every month at 6PM.

As a group, we discuss the latest Bitcoin news from a technical perspective. Sometimes diverging into adjacent fields of privacy, self hosting, free software, and more!

**[See the meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/melbourne-bitcoin-only) to join our group and confirm event details!**

Please feel free to ping someone in the community if joining approval is taking too long!

## News items for this month

Please suggest any noteworthy topics for next month in the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/MelbourneBitDevs/MelbBitDevs/issues)! We're open to discussing pretty much anything Bitcoin or Bitcoin-adjacent!

## Things to note

Attendence is often larger than meetup page RSVPs.

This event is not streamed online, to preserve free discussion, atmosphere, engagement, and community.

To facillitate optimal free and open discussion, privacy of attendees is taken seriously, absolutely no photos/recordings without explicit consent from all parties. [Chatham house rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule) applies.

## Group Activities

We aim to occasionally try new software or tutorials as a group, see [group-activity.md](group-activity.md), building applicable skills within a supportive group environment. It may be useful to bring a laptop machine along with you! MacOS or Linux preferred (for windows [you could use a virtual machine](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-linux-windows-vmware-virtual-machine/)).
